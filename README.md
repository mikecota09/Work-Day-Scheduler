# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to create a simple but effective scheduler for the work day. The scheduler allows the user to input task into the calendar and save them. The calendar highlights the current time slot in red and future times in green to make it easier for the user to track progress of the day.

### Criteria Met
* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* When the user scrolls down they will see time blocks for standard business hours.
* Time blocks are color coded to represent past, present, and future.
* When the user clicks a time block they can enter an event or task.
* When the user clicks the save button it stores the information entered in local storage.
* If the user refreshes the page the saved information will still be there.

### Languages/Frameworks Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
